# commandline_chess
## A basic test project made in C++

KaustuvChess represents the fusion of chess game with modern technology and software engineering principles. This project was a basic demonstration to the power of OOP to construct a fully functional and interactive chess program that not only facilitates thrilling matches between players but also showcases the elegance and flexibility of the OOP concepts.

The implementation of KaustuvChess followed a systematic step-by-step approach. The core chess logic, including move validation and piece behaviors, was established before building the user interface. This approach allowed for a focused development process, ensuring that each component was thoroughly tested before integration.

The chessboard is visually represented using ASCII characters within the command-line interface. Each square on the board is displayed with its content (if any) using characters that correspond to different chess pieces. This representation provides an intuitive view of the current game state.

### Suppose the first player wants to move his king pawn 2 steps, The input is 2,4 to 4,4. 

The user interface provides instructions and prompts in the Nepali language to guide players through the game. Players can input their moves using numeric notation. The interface also handles invalid moves gracefully, notifying players and requesting new inputs when necessary. 

The technical aspects, from system design to technology selection, contributed to the creation of a functional and educational tool. By addressing challenges and providing user-friendly resources, KaustuvChess aims to engage users in an immersive chess experience while fostering a deeper understanding of basic programming concepts.
